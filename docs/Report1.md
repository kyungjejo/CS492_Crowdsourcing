### 1. What is the problem your team is trying to solve? (one sentence)

It is challenging to fully understand solutions and explanations from existing question answering sites and solution booklets.

### 2. How do you know this problem exists? Why is this problem important? Include both (1) external references (e.g., academic papers, news articles, or published surveys), as well as (2) internal investigation (e.g., results from making observations, personal experiences, or interviews with target requesters or workers). (maximum one paragraph)

Even though question answering sites have been helpful to those who have questions that cannot be answered by people around them, they were also limited in that users could not assure that their questions will be answered, or answers they get will be understandable. In the case of the Stackoverflow, excessive reputation and quality control system even made questions hard to survive in the environment, leaving only big questions in the reservoir, without answering individual’s urgent, but small questions. Also, in Fichman’s analysis of more general question answering sites, four question answering sites(Askville, WikiAnswers, Wikipedia Reference Desk, Yahoo! Answers) were analyzed, and it turn out their response rate was 56.44% in average with 74.75% of complete answers, which were easy to be understood. While there are countless materials such as question answering sites and solution booklets that attempt to help us understand and learn better, our personal experiences support that we often fail to learn from them. Personally, I have encountered situations where no answers from stackoverflow could help me set up the right environment to install Torch. Furthermore, I find solutions that are provided by authors for physics problems difficult to understand and learn from. These are a few examples, but any novice learners can experience similar problem as I did. 

### 3. Why use crowdsourcing or social computing for the problem? Why not use machines or individual experts? (maximum one paragraph)

Our project specifically addresses an issue that must be clearly more efficient if it is human-addressed rather than machine-addressed. First of all, these academic queries require natural language processing, for which machines have general difficulty with. Secondly, the problem itself necessitates a human-level understanding on the part of the users, in which fluent communication between the question-asker and the askee is key to the resolution of this issue. Machines, if they do properly decode the human-language query into their systems, will most likely offer answers that are exact, yet not very well-explained on the asker’s level. An example of such difficulties can be seen in the existing system of Wolfram Alpha, in which the machine-assisted answering platform puts considerable limitations on the type of requests and spins out answers that are hard to understand. Now, although experts could be a plausible solution to this issue, it is generally harder to include a one-to-one mapping between the askers and the experts, which means that an expert would have to answer too many questions at once. Such construction would augment the cost and time taken for answering these questions and may lead to an imbalance between the input and the output. Also, it is sometimes harder to understand the professional solutions that experts provide, as the question is too easy for the expert to understand why it may be hard for regular people. Crowdsourcing, on the other hand, enables a free exchange between peers on equal grounds. Since there is a lower entry to barrier, we could have more users participate in answering these questions, saving both time and money on both sides. The peer-to-peer explanation could also be an attractive feature, as the intelligence level of the requesters and the workers are more evenly matched, which means that the answers provided would be accordingly befitting for the askers to understand.

### 4. For the identified problem, discuss with your teammates what specific challenges exist. State these challenges as "How might we..." (HMW) questions. HMW questions serve as a bridge between the identified problem and solution ideas. They are short questions that should be broad enough to allow for open ideas yet narrow enough to set meaningful boundaries. Report at least 10 HMW questions for your team's problem, and pick top 3 HMW questions. This method card from Stanford d.school should be a useful resource.

* __How might we assure the quality of answers?__
* How might we identify user groups that struggle despite existing answers?
* How might we provide users easily understandable solutions?
* How might we identify weaknesses of users?
* How might we assure users with high accessibility to valid solutions?
* How might we let users ask questions clearly?
* How might we make the system accessible?
* How might we provide solutions at right level? 
* __How might we make sure users understand the solution?__
* __How might we provide solutions instantly?__


### 5. Solution Ideas: Solution ideas are your attempts at solving the HMW questions. In your team, discuss how you might address these questions with crowdsourcing or social computing. Report at least 10 solution ideas per each of the top 3 HMW questions, and pick top 3 solution ideas overall. Note that these 3 ideas should be distinct from one another, covering a wide solution space. The best ideas don't necessarily have to represent each HMW; multiple ideas can belong to a single HMW.

#### (1) How might we assure the quality of answers?

* Allow users to enter the system only if they have expertise in certain domain
* Collect personal information of respondents on their expertise
* Evaluate respondent’s quality through using gold data
* Provide How-to manuals to respondents on how to create effective solutions
* Let requesters give feedback on the received answer
* Recruit multiple workers to parallely provide answers to same question
* Use multiple requesters to answer each other’s question to ensure respondents’ motivations
* Compare requesters’ satisfaction with respondents’ certainty
* Rely on previous responses of respondents’ to recommend suitable user
* Recruit multiple workers to validate answers iteratively

#### (2) How might we make sure users understand the solution?

* Make asking-answering communicative
* Give non-monetary rewards when users improve on problems that are hard to understand
* Make the question shown to many people to get various answers
* Let askers solve the quiz to make sure that they understood
* Mark which users did understood the solution and which did not
* Requester should explain his level of knowledge regarding the question
* Make requesters do reflection on what they learned
* Let people who have experience in answering one field do answering again in that domain
* Show examples of easily understandable answers before people make answer
* Optional tutoring sessions

#### (3) How might we provide solutions instantly?

* Push notifications can be turned on
* Time limitation on providing solution after the question was accepted
* Instant chatting/calling sessions may be requested
* Provide better reward for solutions that are provided in shorter time
* Attract large number of people to the system
* Include necessary resources accessible (equations, graphs, concepts, documentations, etc.)
* Provide better reward when large number of question is accumulated
* Allocate a time window when the system is to be most active
* Create a fork system in which parallel responses can be loaded independently
* Show similar previous answers if no people show up to answer the question
